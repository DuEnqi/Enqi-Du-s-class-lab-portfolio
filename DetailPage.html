    <h4>Footage shot in Shanghai, 2024 and Wuhan, 2023</h4>
    <p> I tried construct a sense of Dasein through the visual and audio effects. It portrays a young aspiring individual who, initially enchanted by capitalism as a spectacle, embarks on the quest for self-identity. Throughout his struggling journey navigating through romantic relationships, home-sickness and a reevaluation of the kin——he gradually overcomes his sense of "othering". He undergoes a process of disenchantment, eventually coming to class consciousness as a worker (the very last image was a building site). I have used Shanghai as a symbolic setting under the ideological state apparatus, representing the relics of Western capital promises the but also a breeding ground for leftist, revolutionary ideologies aimed at dismantling the old order. </p>
